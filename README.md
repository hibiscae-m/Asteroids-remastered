Asteroid-remastered is based on the work of Nicolas Koenig and his formation courses : https://www.udemy.com/course/le-cpp-moderne-par-le-developpement-de-jeux/

Most of the assets are from there or handmade (used Zelda's heart containers also).

Huge thanks to Mosh Hamedani and his ultimate C++ course : https://codewithmosh.com
